# rust-nes

An NES emulator, written entirely in Rust.

## Getting Started

This system will use the emulator-standard `.nes` file format, so all of your favorite ROMs should run in it. The goal of the emulator is to be well-suited for homebrew development, so I intend on including a variety of debug tools. However, this repo does not include an assembler, tough a variety of others (such as [NESasm](https://github.com/camsaul/nesasm)) are publicly available.

Given this project is a Rust one, I recommend using `cargo` to build it.
